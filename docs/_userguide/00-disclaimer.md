## User Guide state

Currently, SceneBuilder documentation is not available under an open source license. Parts are available on the Oracle website under a proprietary license and other parts on the Gluon website under an unknown license.

The purpose of this user guide is to centralize the existing documentation with the aim of gradually rewriting the different parts under a license (BSD-3) allowing modifications and updates by the contributors of the SceneBuilder project.

The rewrite work cannot be done quickly. Therefore, part of this user guide consists of links to websites containing existing documentation. We hope that this share will slowly decrease over time.
